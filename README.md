Back in 2008 my interest towards technology grew exponentially right after watching Iron Man.
My mind was blown from just watching how technology can impact our life.
Afterwards I spent my time exploring and gradually was viewed as a Problem Solver
Who solved problems(mostly related to mobiles and computers) by my family and relatives.
I kept my problem solving attitude right through my college and developed amazing projects that solved real life problems around me.
